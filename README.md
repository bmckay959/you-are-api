# You Are API

## About

We hope this site makes 1 person smile someday. Use it while pages are loading, after a hard task was completed or just randomly when they click for a surprise smile.

As a parent, I realize just how important letting my kids hear me say, "You are awesome" or "You are so beautiful". This is me just being the internets ever encouraging parent.
